<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.2</span><span class="cts_passage">There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves. The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.4</span><span class="cts_passage">Do you sleep or do you wake?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.5</span><span class="cts_passage">She answered:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.6</span><span class="cts_passage">‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.7</span><span class="cts_passage">Would you know what I am making?</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.8</span><span class="cts_passage">I am boiling warm beer with butter,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Will you be my guest for supper?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.10</span><span class="cts_passage">‘No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid replied:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.11</span><span class="cts_passage">‘She is sitting in her room,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.12</span><span class="cts_passage">Moaning in her gloom,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Weeping her little eyes quite red,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.14</span><span class="cts_passage">Because old Mr Fox is dead.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.15</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her.’ ‘Certainly, young sir.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.16</span><span class="cts_passage">The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.17</span><span class="cts_passage">The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,  ‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’  ‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.  ‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’  ‘What does he look like, my dear?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.18</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered the cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘Then I will not have him.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.20</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.21</span><span class="cts_passage">And carry old Mr Fox outside.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.1.22</span><span class="cts_passage">But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs Fox out of the house.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.head</span><span class="cts_passage">SECOND STORY</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.2</span><span class="cts_passage">When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The wolf greeted her, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.3</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.4</span><span class="cts_passage">How comes it that alone you sit?</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.5</span><span class="cts_passage">What are you making good?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.6</span><span class="cts_passage">The cat replied:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.7</span><span class="cts_passage">‘In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.8</span><span class="cts_passage">Will you be my guest, and eat?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.9</span><span class="cts_passage">‘No, thank you, Mrs Cat,’ answered the wolf. ‘Is Mrs Fox not at home?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.10</span><span class="cts_passage">The cat said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.11</span><span class="cts_passage">‘She sits upstairs in her room,</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Bewailing her trouble so sore,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.14</span><span class="cts_passage">For old Mr Fox is no more.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.15</span><span class="cts_passage">The wolf answered:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.16</span><span class="cts_passage">‘If she’s in want of a husband now,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Then will it please her to step below?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.18</span><span class="cts_passage">The cat runs quickly up the stair,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.19</span><span class="cts_passage">And lets her tail fly here and there,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.20</span><span class="cts_passage">Until she comes to the parlour door.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.21</span><span class="cts_passage">With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:  ‘Are you within, good Mistress Fox?</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.22</span><span class="cts_passage">If you’re in want of a husband now,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.23</span><span class="cts_passage">Then will it please you to step below?</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Mrs Fox asked: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed mouth?’ ‘No,’ answered the cat. ‘Then he won’t do for me.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.25</span><span class="cts_passage">When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young fox. Then Mrs Fox said: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a little pointed mouth?’ ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has.’ ‘Then let him come upstairs,’ said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.26</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Sweep me the room as clean as you can,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.27</span><span class="cts_passage">Up with the window, fling out my old man!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.28</span><span class="cts_passage">For many a fine fat mouse he brought,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.29</span><span class="cts_passage">Yet of his wife he never thought,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.30</span><span class="cts_passage">But ate up every one he caught.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">49.2.31</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still.</span></div></div>
