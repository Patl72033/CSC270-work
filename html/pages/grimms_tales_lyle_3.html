			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.23</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.25</span><span class="cts_passage">There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Take us across on thy back so white.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.27</span><span class="cts_passage">The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.28</span><span class="cts_passage">THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.29</span><span class="cts_passage">Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw to the cooking.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.30</span><span class="cts_passage">When people are too well off they always begin to long for something new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered, and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was really a very delightful life.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.31</span><span class="cts_passage">Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.32</span><span class="cts_passage">And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.33</span><span class="cts_passage">He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.34</span><span class="cts_passage">So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">15.35</span><span class="cts_passage">Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down, caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable to recover himself, he was drowned.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.1</span><span class="cts_passage">MOTHER HOLLE</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother, however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.3</span><span class="cts_passage">The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.4</span><span class="cts_passage">She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming in every direction.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.5</span><span class="cts_passage">She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.6</span><span class="cts_passage">She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all, are ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.7</span><span class="cts_passage">The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful, however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.8</span><span class="cts_passage">She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and boiled meats every day.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.9</span><span class="cts_passage">So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went to Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will take you home myself.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.11</span><span class="cts_passage">Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from head to foot.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.12</span><span class="cts_passage">‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.13</span><span class="cts_passage">The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old world close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the cock who was perched on the well, called out:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.14</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.15</span><span class="cts_passage">Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.16</span><span class="cts_passage">Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves as before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty my hands for you?’ and walked on.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Presently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my apples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and passed on.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.19</span><span class="cts_passage">At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged herself without delay to the old woman.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.20</span><span class="cts_passage">The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and thought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her, as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came pouring over her.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.21</span><span class="cts_passage">‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut the gate.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.22</span><span class="cts_passage">So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the well called out as she saw her:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.23</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.25</span><span class="cts_passage">But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to her as long as she lived.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.26</span><span class="cts_passage">LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.27</span><span class="cts_passage">Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.28</span><span class="cts_passage">One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.29</span><span class="cts_passage">‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.30</span><span class="cts_passage">The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.31</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.32</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.33</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.34</span><span class="cts_passage">‘To my grandmother’s.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.35</span><span class="cts_passage">‘What have you got in your apron?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.36</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.37</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.38</span><span class="cts_passage">‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.39</span><span class="cts_passage">The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.40</span><span class="cts_passage">Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.41</span><span class="cts_passage">Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked at the door.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.42</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Who is there?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.43</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.44</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot get up.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.45</span><span class="cts_passage">The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.46</span><span class="cts_passage">Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.47</span><span class="cts_passage">She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.48</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.49</span><span class="cts_passage">‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.50</span><span class="cts_passage">‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.51</span><span class="cts_passage">‘The better to see you with, my dear.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.52</span><span class="cts_passage">‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.53</span><span class="cts_passage">‘The better to hug you with.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.54</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.55</span><span class="cts_passage">‘The better to eat you with!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.56</span><span class="cts_passage">And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.57</span><span class="cts_passage">When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.58</span><span class="cts_passage">Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">16.59</span><span class="cts_passage">It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door, that he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: ‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.1</span><span class="cts_passage">THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.2</span><span class="cts_passage">There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided for. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband. She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some time.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is out there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed only replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I will strew ashes along the path.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.3</span><span class="cts_passage">When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest, darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.4</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.5</span><span class="cts_passage">Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.6</span><span class="cts_passage">The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a cage on the wall. Again it cried:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.7</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.8</span><span class="cts_passage">Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.9</span><span class="cts_passage">The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from shaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband lives here?’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.10</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to come to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride, and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.11</span><span class="cts_passage">Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her from view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak, or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an opportunity to escape.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.12</span><span class="cts_passage">The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned, dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.13</span><span class="cts_passage">The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he could not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of the others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers, and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.14</span><span class="cts_passage">‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for the finger and sat down.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.15</span><span class="cts_passage">The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs, opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’ den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father all that had happened.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.16</span><span class="cts_passage">The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast, each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did not say a word.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.17</span><span class="cts_passage">‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no tale you know? Tell us something.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.18</span><span class="cts_passage">‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.19</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.20</span><span class="cts_passage">Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.21</span><span class="cts_passage">and again a second time it said these words.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.22</span><span class="cts_passage">‘My darling, this is only a dream.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.23</span><span class="cts_passage">‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty, and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered, “Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards cook and eat you.”’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.24</span><span class="cts_passage">‘My darling, this is only a dream.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.25</span><span class="cts_passage">‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and yellow, and with that she died.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.26</span><span class="cts_passage">‘My darling, this is only a dream.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.27</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.28</span><span class="cts_passage">‘My darling, this is only a dream.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.29</span><span class="cts_passage">‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the assembled guests.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">17.30</span><span class="cts_passage">The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were condemned to death for their wicked deeds.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.1</span><span class="cts_passage">TOM THUMB</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.2</span><span class="cts_passage">A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is, wife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’ ‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round her wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were ever so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very happy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to pass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So they said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas Thumb.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.3</span><span class="cts_passage">They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born. Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.4</span><span class="cts_passage">One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I want to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that; the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman laughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s bridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to go.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.5</span><span class="cts_passage">When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom was calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer, indeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it goes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried out, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take me down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.6</span><span class="cts_passage">The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me; I’ll soon come back to you.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.7</span><span class="cts_passage">So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a large piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to sit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his father they took him away with them.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.8</span><span class="cts_passage">They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into an old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place, and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain; Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as sulky as could be.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.9</span><span class="cts_passage">When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What dangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I were to fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’ At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. ‘This is lucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting together; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s house of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom. ‘What noise was that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’ They stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll soon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said they. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the sound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him up in their hands. ‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for us?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house, and throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the thieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.11</span><span class="cts_passage">When they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl, ‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened, and said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’ But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again, ‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little urchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and whispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out as loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.12</span><span class="cts_passage">The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light. By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her eyes open.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.13</span><span class="cts_passage">The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug place to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows happen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak, to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. ‘Good lack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about him, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to death. At last down he went into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said he; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.14</span><span class="cts_passage">Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he cried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay! Don’t bring me any more hay!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.15</span><span class="cts_passage">The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the parson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson said, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">18.16</span><span class="cts_passage">Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.</span></div></div>
