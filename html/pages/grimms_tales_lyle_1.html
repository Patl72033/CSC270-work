And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s heir.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.1</span><span class="cts_passage">THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.2</span><span class="cts_passage">There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish. But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’ said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.3</span><span class="cts_passage">When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. ‘Did not you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.4</span><span class="cts_passage">The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.5</span><span class="cts_passage">‘O man of the sea!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Hearken to me!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.7</span><span class="cts_passage">My wife Ilsabill</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.8</span><span class="cts_passage">Will have her own will,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.9</span><span class="cts_passage">And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will? What does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at least,’ said his wife.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.11</span><span class="cts_passage">Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said, ‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him to give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this pretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it very willingly, I know; go along and try!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.12</span><span class="cts_passage">The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went close to the edge of the waves, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.13</span><span class="cts_passage">‘O man of the sea!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.14</span><span class="cts_passage">Hearken to me!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.15</span><span class="cts_passage">My wife Ilsabill</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.16</span><span class="cts_passage">Will have her own will,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.17</span><span class="cts_passage">And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.18</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the man, dolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great castle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it, before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.19</span><span class="cts_passage">The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.’ ‘Then I will,’ said she. ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you be king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say no more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as he cried out:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.20</span><span class="cts_passage">‘O man of the sea!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.21</span><span class="cts_passage">Hearken to me!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.22</span><span class="cts_passage">My wife Ilsabill</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.23</span><span class="cts_passage">Will have her own will,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.24</span><span class="cts_passage">And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.25</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Alas!’ said the poor man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king already.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I think I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to be emperor?’ said the fisherman. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish! I say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go at once!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.27</span><span class="cts_passage">So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, ‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.28</span><span class="cts_passage">‘O man of the sea!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.29</span><span class="cts_passage">Hearken to me!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.30</span><span class="cts_passage">My wife Ilsabill</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.31</span><span class="cts_passage">Will have her own will,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.32</span><span class="cts_passage">And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.33</span><span class="cts_passage">‘What would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor already.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.34</span><span class="cts_passage">So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am emperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing it is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being emperor? I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the fish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.35</span><span class="cts_passage">So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.36</span><span class="cts_passage">‘O man of the sea!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.37</span><span class="cts_passage">Hearken to me!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.38</span><span class="cts_passage">My wife Ilsabill</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.39</span><span class="cts_passage">Will have her own will,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.40</span><span class="cts_passage">And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.41</span><span class="cts_passage">‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my wife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.42</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked at all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’ ‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about that,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot prevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened her husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed. ‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’ said she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave. Go to the fish at once!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.43</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea, and cried out, as well as he could:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.44</span><span class="cts_passage">‘O man of the sea!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.45</span><span class="cts_passage">Hearken to me!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.46</span><span class="cts_passage">My wife Ilsabill</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.47</span><span class="cts_passage">Will have her own will,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.48</span><span class="cts_passage">And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.49</span><span class="cts_passage">‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to be lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty again.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.50</span><span class="cts_passage">And there they live to this very day.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.51</span><span class="cts_passage">THE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.52</span><span class="cts_passage">Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’ said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was the willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it again. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried the bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you are disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.53</span><span class="cts_passage">The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and called in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.54</span><span class="cts_passage">When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.55</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried: ‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won the battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the night.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.56</span><span class="cts_passage">THE FROG-PRINCE</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.57</span><span class="cts_passage">One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.58</span><span class="cts_passage">Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, ‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’ The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could. The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.59</span><span class="cts_passage">The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.60</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Open the door, my princess dear,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.61</span><span class="cts_passage">Open the door to thy true love here!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.62</span><span class="cts_passage">And mind the words that thou and I said</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.63</span><span class="cts_passage">By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.64</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her, asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.65</span><span class="cts_passage">While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.66</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Open the door, my princess dear,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.67</span><span class="cts_passage">Open the door to thy true love here!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.68</span><span class="cts_passage">And mind the words that thou and I said</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.69</span><span class="cts_passage">By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.70</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess, ‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. ‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.71</span><span class="cts_passage">But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.72</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Open the door, my princess dear,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.73</span><span class="cts_passage">Open the door to thy true love here!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.74</span><span class="cts_passage">And mind the words that thou and I said</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.75</span><span class="cts_passage">By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.76</span><span class="cts_passage">And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head of her bed.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.77</span><span class="cts_passage">He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.78</span><span class="cts_passage">The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">9.79</span><span class="cts_passage">They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.1</span><span class="cts_passage">CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.2</span><span class="cts_passage">A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. ‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this, however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home. ‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’ ‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.4</span><span class="cts_passage">The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again. The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off! Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone; what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.5</span><span class="cts_passage">From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of the world.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.6</span><span class="cts_passage">THE GOOSE-GIRL</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.7</span><span class="cts_passage">The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada, and could speak.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.8</span><span class="cts_passage">When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her bridegroom’s kingdom.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.9</span><span class="cts_passage">One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’ And the lock answered her, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.10</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.11</span><span class="cts_passage">Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.12</span><span class="cts_passage">But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’ Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said, ‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.14</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.15</span><span class="cts_passage">Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.16</span><span class="cts_passage">And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada, and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maid’s shabby ones.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.17</span><span class="cts_passage">At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was Curdken.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.20</span><span class="cts_passage">But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was, she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and nailed it up under the dark gate.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.21</span><span class="cts_passage">Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate, she said sorrowfully:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.22</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.23</span><span class="cts_passage">and the head answered:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.24</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.25</span><span class="cts_passage">Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.27</span><span class="cts_passage">Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the locks out, but she cried:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.28</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Blow, breezes, blow!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.29</span><span class="cts_passage">Let Curdken’s hat go!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.30</span><span class="cts_passage">Blow, breezes, blow!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.31</span><span class="cts_passage">Let him after it go!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.32</span><span class="cts_passage">O’er hills, dales, and rocks,</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Away be it whirl’d</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Till the silvery locks</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.35</span><span class="cts_passage">Are all comb’d and curl’d!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.36</span><span class="cts_passage">Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky, and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.37</span><span class="cts_passage">The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">10.38</span><span class="cts_passage">‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’</span></div></div>
